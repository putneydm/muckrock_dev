				<p>The facts are murky, the implications dire.

Markee) on ExtraSensory Perception in Dogs. The final report was 16 pages. Sixteen pages that have never been, as far as I can tell, released publicly.</p>

				<p>We now have official confirmation of the report's existence. 16 pages that are, as of now, being held and <a href="">reviewed by the Army</a> Public Affairs Office.</p>
