	<!--
	This is the right rail monitor that shows site activity. It will appear in the right sidebar on multiple pages. 
	This version shows all the of the variations of items that will show up in the sidebar.
	Items include:
	- Any new requests people post that are public.
	- Any requests that have been returned.
	- People who have backed requests.
	- Requests that need financial support.
	- People who have provided financial support.
	- News stories that have been posted.
	- New podcast episodes. 
	- Requests that have been forked.
	- Overdue requests
	
	All of the variations should be reflected here.
	I'm not sure on the number of items that should appear. I'd say no more than seven or eight. We'll have to see what the volume is.
	They should be ordered by recency.
	
	I guessed at what the correct CTA for each item would be. There's a button and a link varation. If you need to change them, that's fine.
